# Store built with [Redux-First Router](https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router)

Inhertia wanted a customized shop built in MERN. It uses React Universal Component for SSR, and hot reloading. The application uses APIs such as Stripe, Mailgun, and Instagram. The application also has it's own backend built in Mongo, and Express for the owner to manage products from guests and customers. It uses CRUD and MVC methodologies. The shop has a backend for customers to track their orders.
